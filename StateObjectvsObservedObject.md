@StateObject and @ObservedObject are both used in SwiftUI to manage reference-type model data (typically a class conforming to ObservableObject), but they serve different purposes in terms of ownership and lifecycle.

### 🧠 Quick Summary
Property Wrapper	Ownership	When to Use
@StateObject	✅ Creates and owns the object	Use when the view creates the object
@ObservedObject	🚫 Uses an existing object	Use when the object is passed in or owned elsewhere

### 🔍 @StateObject
Introduced in iOS 14

Used to create and manage the lifecycle of the ObservableObject.

SwiftUI keeps the object alive across view redraws.

### ✅ Use Case:
When your view is the source of truth for the object.

```swift
class Counter: ObservableObject {
    @Published var count = 0
}

struct CounterView: View {
    @StateObject var counter = Counter() // View creates and owns it

    var body: some View {
        Text("Count: \(counter.count)")
        Button("Increment") {
            counter.count += 1
        }
    }
}
```

### 🔍 @ObservedObject
You inject an existing ObservableObject.

The view does not own it — it only observes it.

Lifecycle is managed outside the view.

### ✅ Use Case:
When the object is created elsewhere and passed in.

```swift
struct CounterView: View {
    @ObservedObject var counter: Counter // Passed from parent

    var body: some View {
        Text("Count: \(counter.count)")
        Button("Increment") {
            counter.count += 1
        }
    }
}
```
And used like:


@StateObject var counter = Counter()

CounterView(counter: counter) // Passing ownership to child
❗️Common Mistake:
Initializing an ObservableObject with @ObservedObject inside a view — this causes the object to be recreated every redraw, losing its state.


// ❌ Wrong — this will reset on every view redraw
@ObservedObject var model = MyModel() 
Use @StateObject in this case instead.

✅ Rule of Thumb:
If your view creates the model, use @StateObject.

If your view receives the model, use @ObservedObject.


if we're receiving stateobject in child as observedobject, will this observedobject passed state resets everytime the child re-renders


### Excellent question — and you're touching on a very important detail of @StateObject and @ObservedObject interaction in parent-child SwiftUI views.

### ✅ Short Answer:
No, the @ObservedObject in the child does not reset if it's passed a @StateObject from the parent.
The state is preserved across child view re-renders.

### 🔍 Why?
@StateObject ensures the lifecycle and memory of the model is managed by the parent.

When the parent passes this model to the child as an @ObservedObject, the child does not own or recreate the object — it merely observes it.

As long as the parent holds onto the @StateObject, the child receives the same reference.

✅ Example
```swift
class Counter: ObservableObject {
    @Published var value = 0
}

struct ParentView: View {
    @StateObject var counter = Counter()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Parent Count: \(counter.value)")
            ChildView(counter: counter) // Passes to child
        }
    }
}

struct ChildView: View {
    @ObservedObject var counter: Counter // Receives from parent

    var body: some View {
        Button("Increment") {
            counter.value += 1
        }
    }
}
```
The counter object is created once in ParentView via @StateObject.

ChildView observes it via @ObservedObject.

Even if ChildView is redrawn (e.g. conditional rendering), it observes the same instance.

❗️Gotcha to Avoid
If you accidentally write this in the child:

swift
Copy
Edit
// ❌ BAD: Recreates the model every time the view redraws
@ObservedObject var counter = Counter()
This would recreate the model every render — losing state — because @ObservedObject does not manage the object's lifecycle. You should never initialize the object like this in a child view.

✅ Best Practice
Scenario	Use
View creates and owns the model	@StateObject
View receives the model	@ObservedObject
View reads-only data (optional)	@EnvironmentObject
