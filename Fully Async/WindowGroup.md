In SwiftUI, WindowGroup is the entry point for your app‚Äôs UI in a SwiftUI lifecycle app (introduced in iOS 14). It's the SwiftUI equivalent of setting up your main window in UIKit.

### ü™ü What is WindowGroup?
A WindowGroup defines a scene that can manage multiple windows of your app‚Äôs content ‚Äî especially on platforms like macOS and iPadOS (with multi-window support). On iPhone, it just shows one window at a time.

‚úÖ Example:

@main
struct MyApp: App {
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
    }
}
@main marks this as the app‚Äôs entry point.

WindowGroup creates the app‚Äôs main window.

ContentView() is the root view for this window.

### üîÅ Why ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù?
Because WindowGroup:

Supports multiple windows (especially on iPad/macOS).

Maintains independent state for each window.

Automatically manages scene lifecycle (activation, backgrounding, etc.).

### üß± How it Works

var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup {
        NavigationStack {
            HomeView()
        }
    }
}
You can wrap your navigation, tab view, or any other root component here.

SwiftUI will launch this UI inside the window scene of the app.

### üß† Related Scene Types
Scene Type	Purpose
WindowGroup	Main app window, supports multiple instances
DocumentGroup	For document-based apps
Settings	macOS settings window
MenuBarExtra	macOS menu bar items

### ‚ùóÔ∏èPlatform Behavior
Platform	WindowGroup Behavior
iPhone	Single window only
iPadOS	Multi-window supported
macOS	Full multi-window app


### üß† What is SceneDelegate?

SceneDelegate is part of the UIKit app lifecycle introduced in iOS 13. It was designed to help support multiple windows (scenes) in apps ‚Äî especially for iPadOS and macOS Catalyst ‚Äî and works alongside the traditional AppDelegate.

SceneDelegate manages the UI lifecycle of a single scene (window) of your app.

It‚Äôs called for:

Setting up the window and root view controller

Responding to scene lifecycle events like becoming active/inactive

Managing multi-window UI on iPad/macOS

### üèóÔ∏è When Is It Used?
In UIKit-based apps with a SceneDelegate.swift file (created by Xcode templates for iOS 13+).

Not used in SwiftUI App lifecycle (@main struct MyApp: App) ‚Äî SwiftUI uses WindowGroup and Scene.

### üì¶ Typical SceneDelegate Setup
```swift
class SceneDelegate: UIResponder, UIWindowSceneDelegate {
    var window: UIWindow?

    func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession,
               options connectionOptions: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
        guard let windowScene = scene as? UIWindowScene else { return }

        let window = UIWindow(windowScene: windowScene)
        window.rootViewController = UIHostingController(rootView: ContentView())
        self.window = window
        window.makeKeyAndVisible()
    }
}
```
This code sets up a SwiftUI view (ContentView) as the root of a UIKit window.

Called when a new scene (window) is being connected.

### üîÅ SceneDelegate vs AppDelegate
Aspect	AppDelegate	SceneDelegate
Scope	Entire App	Individual Scene (Window)
Introduced in	iOS 2	iOS 13
Handles	Launch, background, notifications	UI lifecycle of a window (scene)
Required in SwiftUI	‚ùå No (SwiftUI uses App protocol)	‚ùå No (replaced by SwiftUI scene system)

### ‚úÖ When to Use SceneDelegate
UIKit apps targeting iOS 13+ with multiple scenes

If you‚Äôre not using SwiftUI App lifecycle

Apps that support multi-window behavior (iPad, Mac Catalyst)

### ‚ùå When It's Not Used
In SwiftUI apps using the @main App protocol (WindowGroup, etc.), there‚Äôs no SceneDelegate.
SwiftUI uses a declarative Scene system instead.
