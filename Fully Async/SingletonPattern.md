The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

### üß© What is the Singleton Pattern?
In Swift, a typical singleton looks like this:

```swift
final class MySingleton {
    static let shared = MySingleton()
    
    private init() {
        // private to prevent outside instantiation
    }

    func doSomething() {
        print("Doing work...")
    }
}
```

### ‚úÖ Pros of Singleton Pattern
Advantage	Description
Global access	Easy to access the single instance from anywhere.
Lazy initialization	Created only when first accessed (in Swift, via static let).
Resource sharing	Useful for shared resources (e.g., network manager, database connection).
Thread-safe by default	Swift‚Äôs static let is lazily initialized and thread-safe.

### ‚ùå Cons of Singleton Pattern
Disadvantage	Description
Global state	Makes the program harder to understand and debug due to hidden dependencies.
Hard to test	Tightly coupled and difficult to mock or inject during testing.
Hidden dependencies	Encourages anti-patterns like accessing shared state from anywhere.
Difficult lifecycle management	Can lead to memory or resource management issues in complex apps.
Concurrency issues	If the singleton holds mutable state, it must be carefully synchronized.

‚úÖ When to Use
Shared resources: NetworkManager, Database, UserSession

When only one instance makes logical sense (e.g., AppConfig, Logger)

‚ùå When to Avoid
When testability and loose coupling are priorities

When dependency injection would offer better flexibility

In large systems where global state can introduce fragility


### Testable Singleton

Great ‚Äî here's how you can make a Singleton more testable and flexible using protocols and dependency injection.

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Define a Protocol
This helps decouple your code from the singleton implementation.

```swift
protocol NetworkService {
    func fetchData() async -> String
}
```

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Create a Singleton Conforming to the Protocol

```swift
final class NetworkManager: NetworkService {
    static let shared = NetworkManager()
    private init() {}

    func fetchData() async -> String {
        return "Real data from network"
    }
}
```

‚úÖ Step 3: Inject Dependency
Inject the protocol instead of directly accessing the singleton.

```swift
class ViewModel {
    private let service: NetworkService

    init(service: NetworkService) {
        self.service = service
    }

    func loadData() async {
        let data = await service.fetchData()
        print("Loaded: \(data)")
    }
}
```

### üîÅ Summary
Without DI (classic singleton)	With DI & Protocols
Harder to test	Easy to test with mocks
Tight coupling	Loose coupling
Less flexible	Swappable implementations

This approach gives you the benefits of singletons (shared state) while keeping testability and modularity.
